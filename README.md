### The Challenge
Create a one game tennis simulation

### Stack
 - Chosen stack
    - NodeJS JavaScript
    - Small code base and easy setup
    - Used CLI Prompts to simulate game
    - Used Jest for testing
    - No error handling as no input from user is required, only options to select from

### How the game works
    - Prompt options of a list of famous tennis players to select who will be player 1 and 2
    - You then select who serves
    - It will show who's playing who [name] vs [name]
    - The game now starts with the two selected players where you select who gets the next point
    - It will end with the winner once there is two clear points from 40 points
    - It will display DEUCE when both players reach 40 - 40
    - It will go to ADV and come back to DEUCE if the opposing player gets the point
